                        <p>MyTime is a task managing webapp designed to be simple and easy to use for
                        students to track their time. We aim to help students improve their time
                        management skills and reflect on their progress.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Our team is made up of seven freshmen from the University of Illinois at

                        Science majors.</p>

                        intended business major, and Helena Chi, Computer Science and Linguistics
                        major.</p>
                        <p>The back-end duo is Zhuoyue Wang, Statistics and Computer Science major, and Wanyu Bi, Environmental
                        Science major.</p>
